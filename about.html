                    Welcome to our <strong>Cybersecurity Lab</strong> – a space where aspiring hackers, students, and cybersecurity professionals can practice and refine their skills. This platform is specifically designed as part of the <strong>TryHackMe</strong> room challenges to simulate real-world vulnerabilities in web applications.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Our primary goal is to provide a learning experience through hands-on challenges. Whether you're new to cybersecurity or an experienced ethical hacker, this lab offers a variety of challenges that will test your skills in identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities. The idea behind this platform is to bridge the gap between theory and practical application, allowing you to develop a deeper understanding of cybersecurity.
                </p>
                
                <h2>What You’ll Find Here:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):</strong> This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page. These scripts are then reflected back to users, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information or unauthorized actions on their behalf.</li>
                    <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> SQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate a website's database queries. This can result in unauthorized access to data, including login credentials and other sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability will allow you to bypass login pages or retrieve hidden data.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):</strong> CSRF attacks trick users into performing unwanted actions on web applications where they are authenticated. By exploiting this vulnerability, you can force users to submit forms or requests unknowingly, resulting in unauthorized actions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>How It Works:</h2>
                <p>
                    Your objective is to find and exploit these vulnerabilities. Once you successfully identify a bug, you’ll be rewarded with a <strong>flag</strong>, which confirms that the vulnerability has been found and exploited correctly.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Our platform offers hints along the way, but the challenges are designed to encourage critical thinking and creative problem-solving. You will need to explore every aspect of the site – from the source code to the request headers – to uncover the hidden vulnerabilities.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Why We Created This Lab:</h2>
                <p>
                    The world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and we believe that practical experience is key to staying ahead of emerging threats. This lab was created to provide users with a safe and interactive environment to explore these vulnerabilities, learn from them, and ultimately become better at securing real-world applications.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Join Us:</h2>
                <p>
                    Whether you're here to enhance your hacking skills or just for the fun of the challenge, we welcome you to our lab. We hope that by working through these challenges, you'll gain a deeper understanding of web security and feel more confident in tackling real-world security issues.
